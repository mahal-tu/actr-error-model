# ACT-R Error Model

The model uses the [ACT-R](http://act-r.psy.cmu.edu/) cognitive architecture.

## How to run

The model depends on the "lean embedded lisp" sub-project of [ACT-CV](http://act-cv.sourceforge.net/)

If you want to use it without ACT-CV, you need to fill the visicon 
and audicon and handle clicks and shouts by yourself.
